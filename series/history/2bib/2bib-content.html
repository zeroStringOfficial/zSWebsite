In essence, there was no way to achieve consensus on the validity of transactions without a central authority; there was too much control from leadership; or, all legal ramifications went directly back to the creators and starters of these technologies.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">The initial steps towards solving the issue of centralisation within digital currency started when Adam Back implemented Proof of Work (PoW) in Hashcash. Proof of Work was initially proposed as a way to prove the expenditure of computational effort, and it was implemented as a &ldquo;cost function&rdquo; in Hashcash. It was used as &ldquo;a mechanism to throttle systematic abuse of un-metered internet resources such as email, and anonymous remailers&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the form of a hash computation&rdquo; [2,18]. It worked by forcing computers to complete a &ldquo;cost-function&rdquo; or &ldquo;work&rdquo;, thus verifying the user and enabling them to perform actions (i.e., send an email or any task). The idea is that when you wish to perform actions as a standard user, these cost functions are executed and should only take seconds to complete and not noticeably impede your experience. The cost function &ldquo;should be efficiently verifiable, but parameterisably expensive to compute&rdquo; [2]. However, if you want to maliciously spam a network that uses cost functions, you would need to multiply the number of network tasks such as sending an email, by the &lsquo;work&rsquo; time per task [2]. For example, if you wish to spam by sending 10,000 emails and the work required per email takes two seconds, sending 10,000 emails would take about five and a half hours, as well as all the energy required for every arbitrary guess that makes up each piece of work. This would result in a significant hurdle for spammers, as the amount of computing power and energy requirements increase the more they wish to spam, whereas the average user would hardly notice a difference. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Additionally, something that makes the &lsquo;work&rsquo; or &lsquo;cost-function&rsquo; particularly robust and valuable</span><span class="c9 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">is that it is &ldquo;non-interactive, publicly auditable [and] trapdoor-free with unbounded probabilistic cost&rdquo; [2]. Being &ldquo;trapdoor-free&rdquo; means it has no hidden vulnerability or shortcut; &ldquo;non-interactive&rdquo; means clients can solve the puzzle without the constant need for communication between the client and server; &ldquo;unbounded probabilistic cost&rdquo; means there is no deterministic way to predict what is needed to solve the puzzle. This was perfect for Bitcoin&rsquo;s mining process as it forces miners into a probabilistic process where more hardware and energy expended means a higher chance of success, creating a barrier for attackers, and increasing the security of Bitcoin&rsquo;s network as a whole. This summarises that Adam Back didn&rsquo;t come up with the solution for the centralisation of digital currency, he however created the tools for it. </span><span class="c9 c15">If you wish to learn how exactly this is implemented within the Bitcoin network, our new-user-friendly article on consensus has you covered.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c11">2.2 Satoshi Nakamoto</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, adapted Adam Back&#39;s findings to suit the needs of the first decentralised currency, implemented as a blockchain. The first issue faced was the idea of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) [1]. The concept boiled down is how to validate transactions in the guaranteed presence of adverse validators or Miners to enable a decentralised consensus mechanism. Where &lsquo;Generals&rsquo; have to agree on whether to attack or retreat from a city without knowing if the communication to attack or retreat from other &lsquo;Generals&rsquo; is 100% untampered and genuine [1]. If all attack, then the attack is successful, if all retreat then the retreat is successful, however, if there is a mix of attack and retreat, failure is yielded. This directly aligns with decentralised transaction consensus, if &lsquo;Generals&rsquo; or Nodes agree on a proposed transaction then it is a successful transaction and will be added to the blockchain. If they agree to retreat, the transaction is agreed as invalid (malicious or faulty) and is discarded. If however, the validators cannot agree if a transaction is valid or not, this will fail consensus and the decentralised consensus of any blockchain. In Bitcoin&rsquo;s case, if 51% of mining/hashing power is legitimate and agrees that the proposed block containing new transactions is valid, the new block is added to the chain. The 51% threshold is key because as long as 51% of mining power is honest, they will continue to outpace attackers by producing a chain with more work. This also prevents the &lsquo;double spend&rsquo; problem as you would need such a dominant share (an amount infeasible for most countries) of energy and computing power to stop a majority of honest miners from overriding dishonest transactions. This increases what Bitcoin provides further as it is a currency that cannot be debased without tremendous effort by design, something thought impossible not too long ago. An example of overriding a threshold is the Ronin blockchain, where a critical mass (five of the nine) validators were exploited, therefore overriding consensus, resulting in an &ldquo;over $600 million&rdquo; hack [4].</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Satoshi was able to solve the BFT problem by collaborating Adam Back&rsquo;s implementation of Proof-of-Work with &ldquo;the longest chain&rdquo; rule [3]. This rule states the longest chain is the chain to be accepted, as it has the most work and blocks, which would require the most effort for an attacker to overwrite [3]. Satoshi&rsquo;s consensus mechanism that uses longest-chain Proof-of-Work is then leveraged with Game Theory principles. Where miners are incentivised to play by the rules by contributing hashing power to receive Bitcoin as a reward for correctly mining blocks. This competition encourages miners to continually improve their efficiency and increase their hashing power to secure these rewards, to compete as efficiently as possible, maximising rewards. As a result, the network becomes more secure and increases the threshold of a successful attack for bad actors, again incentivising would-be attackers to use their knowledge, hardware and electricity to participate and earn. Bitcoins Game Theory can also appear in many forms, one example could be where competing PLC mining companies such as Clean Spark accrue more hardware and cheaper energy to stay competitive and increase shareholder value while increasing the security of the network [5]. These forms of Game Theory culminate into a strong incentive structure, increasing the likelihood a participant will honestly participate, contributing to an insurmountable threshold which further increases the challenge of attackers. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">However, while these breakthroughs were imperative to the success of Bitcoin and DeFi, they also opened the door to new challenges for the young technology, which will be discussed in </span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://zerostring.net/series/history/3bib/3bib.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1722253968989003&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RnbeLyfdvON8by-T4xar3">Part 3: Decentralised Currency Challenges and Beyond</a></span><span class="c9">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c6 c13"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17">References:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>[1] - Pease, M., Shostak, R. and Lamport, L.
